Creating a personal Bionic Reading extension

I find it incredibly hard to follow and decipher sentences and words on a screen (with the exception of code, for some reason),
 making reading longer articles incredibly difficult for me. I came across this reading method called Bionic reading and found that it helped me a lot to 'speed' read sentences. After searching for an extension, I only found one that forced you to load a pages content into a different window.

I decided to try to make my own which modifies the existing page but preserves it's layout and all other elements.
